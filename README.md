# Pentesting Starter Kit
 A collection of info and files to help with a quick start to penetration testing

I have included serveral different resources that I think are a good start for penetration testing. I have sorted these into categories (the subfolders in this repo). 

Category descriptions:

*Kali Linux- This is a ditro very useful for pentesting, all actual testing you do can be done through here

*Legal Stuff- This is a group of documents useful for if you evr publish any code or take any code related jobs. All checked over by a practicing solicitor.

*Resources- This is just extra stuff I think may help you along, such as pdfs and links
