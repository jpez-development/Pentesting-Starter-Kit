Kali is a Linux distribution that comes pre-installed with many commonly used pentesting tools.
It is all catergorised from Footprinting and enumeration to post-exploitation and OSINT.

You can get disc images and pre-built virtual machines of Kali from their website (https://www.kali.org/downloads/)
I would recommend using a VM for most work as it allows you to snapshot your machine and revert back to these as need (great for when testing things), persistent storage,
and the ability to make the machine act as if it was a seperate device from the one you are operating on. 

Disc images are useful because you can create bootable usb drives that all you to use kali on any machine through the bios, there is more info on how to do this at this link:
https://www.kali.org/docs/usb/live-usb-install-with-windows/

(Another useful bootable image to have is hirens, this os allows you to do fancy things with the windows operating system but is more a tool than a os to use daily.

To use Kali on Virtualbox (an open source vm software), first install VBox(https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.22/VirtualBox-6.1.22-144080-Win.exe).

Then, double click this file after download 
(http://www.smartredirect.de/redir/clickGate.php?u=IgKHHLBT&m=1&p=8vZ5ugFkSx&t=vHbSdnLT&st=&s=&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.kali.org%2Fvirtual-images%2Fkali-linux-2021.1-vbox-amd64.ova&r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.offensive-security.com%2Fkali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download%2F%231572305786534-030ce714-cc3b)

this will import a prebuilt version of kali into your Vbox.

The user and password for the VM is:
user: kali
pass: kali

when you first run, open a terminnal and enter these two comands:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

This will make sure all your software is up-to-date.
